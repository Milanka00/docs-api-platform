### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)


### Prerequisites

A Docker-compatible container runtime such as:

- Docker Desktop (Windows / macOS)
- Rancher Desktop (Windows / macOS)
- Colima (macOS)
- Docker Engine + Compose plugin (Linux)

Ensure `docker` and `docker compose` commands are available.

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

```bash
# Download distribution.
wget https://github.com/wso2/api-platform/releases/download/ai-gateway/v1.2.0-rc2/wso2apip-ai-gateway-1.2.0-rc2.zip

# Unzip the downloaded distribution.
unzip wso2apip-ai-gateway-1.2.0-rc2.zip

cd wso2apip-ai-gateway-1.2.0/

# Run the one-time setup. This provisions the AES-256 at-rest encryption key, the router HTTPS
# listener certificate, api-platform.env, and the gateway-controller admin credentials. It prints
# the admin password once — copy it.
./scripts/setup.sh

# Export the admin credentials so the management-API calls below can authenticate.
# The username defaults to "admin"; use the password setup.sh just printed.
export ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export ADMIN_PASSWORD='<the password scripts/setup.sh printed>'

# Start the complete stack
docker compose -p ai-gateway up -d

# Verify gateway controller admin endpoint is running
curl http://localhost:9094/api/admin/v1/health
```

!!! note "Running on Windows"
    The commands above assume a Linux/macOS shell. On Windows, run the one-time setup with the PowerShell script instead — it takes the same flags and provisions the same files:

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup.ps1
    ```

    Then set the admin credentials with `$env:ADMIN_USERNAME='admin'` and `$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD='<the password setup.ps1 printed>'` in place of the `export` lines.

    The remaining `curl` commands on this page pipe their YAML payload in through a shell heredoc (`--data-binary @- <<'EOF'`), which PowerShell does not support. Either run them from Git Bash or WSL, or save the YAML between `EOF` markers to a file and post that file explicitly — note the `.exe`, since `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest` in Windows PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/management/v1/mcp-proxies `
      -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" `
      -u "${env:ADMIN_USERNAME}:${env:ADMIN_PASSWORD}" `
      --data-binary "@mcp-proxy.yaml"
    ```

## Deploy an MCP proxy configuration

Start the sample MCP server

```bash
docker run -p 3001:3001 --name everything --network ai-gateway_gateway-network rakhitharr/mcp-everything:v3
```

Run the following command to deploy the MCP proxy.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/management/v1/mcp-proxies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
  -u "$ADMIN_USERNAME:$ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: Mcp
metadata:
  name: everything-mcp-v1.0
  annotations:
    "gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/project-id": "default"
spec:
  displayName: Everything
  version: v1.0
  context: /everything
  specVersion: "2025-06-18"
  upstream:
    url: http://everything:3001
  tools: []
  resources: []
  prompts: []
EOF
```
To test MCP traffic routing through the gateway, add the following URL to your MCP client and connect to the server.

```
http://localhost:8080/everything/mcp
```

## View the MCP proxy in AI Workspace

The gateway syncs the artifacts you deploy on it up to [AI Workspace](../../../next/ai-workspace/overview.md), the control plane for AI traffic across your organization. The `everything-mcp-v1.0` proxy you deployed above appears there without being re-declared, in the `default` project named in its `project-id` annotation. See [Manage Gateway-deployed AI artifacts in AI Workspace](../../../next/ai-workspace/sync-gateway-created-artifacts.md).

## Stopping the Gateway

Stop and remove the MCP backend first.

```bash
docker stop everything
docker rm everything
```

When stopping the gateway, you have two options:

### Option 1: Stop runtime, keep data (persisted proxies and configuration)

```bash
docker compose -p ai-gateway down
```

This stops the containers but preserves the `controller-data` volume. When you restart with `docker compose -p ai-gateway up`, all your API configurations will be restored.

### Option 2: Complete shutdown with data cleanup (fresh start)

```bash
docker compose -p ai-gateway down -v
```
This stops containers and removes the `controller-data` volume. Next startup will be a clean slate with no persisted proxies or configuration.
